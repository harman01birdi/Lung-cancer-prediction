# Lung Cancer Survival Prediction ü©∫üß†
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using supervised machine learning techniques. clinical features like age, gender, and cancer stage. Achieved 77% accuracy using Random Forest Classifier and feature importance analysis.


## üìä Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict whether a lung cancer patient is likely to survive based on medical features.
- **Model Used:** Random Forest Classifier,Xgboost,Logistic regression & KNN
- **Accuracy Achieved:** 77%
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Classification Report Feature Importance

## Features Used
- Age
- Gender
- Cancer Stage
- Diagnosis_date
- Smoking_status
- Bmi
- Cholesterol_level
- Hypertension
- Asthma
- Cirrhosis
- Treatment_type

## üß† Key Learnings

- **Cancer stage** had the highest impact on survival.
- **Age** showed moderate impact.
- **Gender** had less influence but still contributed to the model's performance.
- Feature importance analysis helped validate clinical assumptions.

 ## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies & Tools

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier, GridSearchCV)


## Model Accuracy
- Using different MODLE'S like LOGISTIC REGRESSION , KNN , XGBOOST & RANDOM-FOREST and Achieved 77% accuracy using RANDOM-FOREST
- Used ACCURACY_SCORE, MSE , CLASSIFICATION_REPORT and Feature Importance analysis
